          <h3>What is Hazardhive ?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Hazardhive is the most used risk assessment software that is based
            on the bowtie method. It enables you to easily create bowtie
            diagrams to assess risk. Hazardhive is unique in its ability to
            visualize complex risks in a way that is understandable, yet also
            allows for detailed risk-based improvement plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bowtie diagram presents the danger you face in a single,
            understandable picture. It is simple to discern between the
            proactive and reactive facets of risk management thanks to the
            diagram's bowtie-like shape. HazardHive's bowtie diagram summarises
            several possible event scenarios and shows the measures you have in
            place to handle them. Designed with the end user in mind, Hazardhive
            software is among the most user-friendly risk assessment tools.
            Using HazardHive to create a diagram is easy, and the application
            lets you update the diagram to reflect the current condition of your
            safety barriers.

          <h3>Safety protocols visualization</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            The bowtie technique clearly shows your risk management plan and
            arranges the major hazards facing your organization. The barriers in
            the bowtie diagram show the controls you have in place to prevent,
            reduce, or eliminate serious outcomes. Holding barriers accountable
            makes it obvious what everyone needs to do to operate safely. By
            giving precise daily operating information, operational staff can
            take ownership of the bowties when they are involved in their
            construction.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use Hazardhive to see your safety protocols on the diagram.
            Every action can be connected to the barrier it supports. Finding
            safety-critical actions that are performed to guarantee the ongoing
            integrity of risk barriers is the primary goal of the SMS. When all
            the data is shown on the bowtie, everyone can see the full risk
            context and the tasks they are responsible for.
          </p>

          <h3>Safety protocols assessment & accountability</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Once a bowtie diagram has been created, you can assess and look over
            the safety measures you've implemented. Among other things, these
            barriers can be classified according to their type, effectiveness,
            and accountability. Examine the efficacy of your barriers to obtain
            instant visual insight into their strength. By examining the various
            types of obstacles, you can increase the organization's resilience
            and reduce the chance of common mode failure. Color coding is
            commonly used to show how effective hazardhive barriers are, which
            can be customized to your needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Customizable job titles can be used to connect accountability to
            barriers. This makes it easier to understand who is in charge of
            maintaining safety barriers. It increases ownership of barrier
            performance and makes clear what everyone must do to operate safely.

          <h3>Communication at different levels of abstraction</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Bowtie diagrams allow easy risk communication by making the risk
            visible and understandable at the right abstraction level.
            Organizations are disseminating the bowtie diagrams by emphasizing
            significant risk control issues, such as through brochures,
            pocketbooks, and posters. Web-based bowtie diagrams are also
            becoming more and more common in online training and information
            systems. This ensures that risk communication is fully integrated
            within the organization.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/src/assets/images/image (19).png"
            alt="Structure knowledge example"
          />
          <p>
            In addition to being simple to comprehend, bowties offer a summary
            and insight into risk assessment and analysis. This is because
            bowtie diagrams focus on the important components and keep context
            intact while reducing complexity to a reasonable size. Using the
            software's various filter options, you may share the bowtie diagram
            with every department in your company. Without removing any data,
            filters enable you to select which information should be shown on
            your diagram. To display the pertinent nodes for this specific
            accountable person, for instance, you can filter the diagram based
            on a node type.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, bowtie diagrams can be used to show that risks are
            being managed. This gives management the confidence that risks are
            being appropriately controlled. Many authorities across a range of
            industries advise using bowtie diagrams in safety investigations or
            safety cases due to their visual impact.

            Making a diagram in HazardHive is straightforward. By right-clicking
            over elements (lines or nodes) and utilizing the window that
            displays, you can add more bowtie elements. Additionally, Hazardhive
            offers robust search filters for tasks like group operations. For
            instance, you can select many elements and make group adjustments to
            your diagrams using this functionality. – you can change the title
            of a group of barriers at once or set the effectiveness of them.
            Additionally, models can be imported and exported, and many models
            can be combined to create a single model, enabling numerous
            individuals to work on sub-models simultaneously before combining
            them.

          <p>
            ​​You can utilize Hazardhive's filters to let your staff or
            management know specific information about the bowtie models. By
            just picking the elements you don't want to display, you can use the
            selective visibility filter to decide which information should be
            hidden. You can filter on almost any element you added to the
            diagram using the advanced filter.

            Hazardhive allows you to generate additional information, as per the
            organizational needs, as metadata that can be associated with nodes.

            Moreover, You can e.g. modify any label in the software to fit your
            own terminology needs. For example, the term "barrier", which is
            frequently used in certain industries, can be replaced with "safety
            control" according to your organizational needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Hazardhive's software offers a standard taxonomy, some
            organizations need taxonomies that are more industry-specific. You
            may customize the barrier kinds, barrier effectiveness, and other
            factors to meet the demands of your company.
