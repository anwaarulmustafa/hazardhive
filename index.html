          <h3>What is hazardhive?</h3>
          <p>
            hazardhive is the most used risk assessment software that is based
            on the bowtie method. It enables you to easily create bowtie
            diagrams to assess risk. hazardhive is unique in its ability to
            visualize complex risks in a way that is understandable, yet also
            allows for detailed risk-based improvement plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bowtie diagram visualizes the risk you are dealing with in one
            understandable picture. The diagram is shaped like a bowtie,
            creating a clear differentiation between the proactive and reactive
            side of risk management. In hazardhive, the bowtie diagram provides
            you with an overview of multiple plausible incident scenarios and
            shows what barriers you have in place to control these scenarios.
            hazardhive software is developed with the end-user in mind, making
            it one of the most user-friendly risk assessment tools. It is easy
            to create a diagram in hazardhive, but the software also enables you
            to maintain the diagram so it will always represent the current
            status of your safety barriers.
          </p>

          <h3>Structure knowledge</h3>
          <p>
            The bowtie method structures major hazards of your organization and
            gives you a clear overview of how your hazards are controlled. The
            barriers in the bowtie diagram show what controls you have in place
            to prevent, mitigate or eliminate major consequences from happening.
            Making people responsible for barriers makes transparent what
            everybody is supposed to do to operate safely. When operational
            staff is involved in the development of a bowtie, accurate daily
            operation information is included and this way staff will take
            ownership of the bowties.
          </p>
          <p>
            hazardhive provides the possibility to visualize your Safety
            Management System (SMS) on the diagram. Each activity can be traced
            back to the barrier it is supporting. The SMS exists primarily in
            identifying safety critical activities, undertaken to assure the
            on-going integrity of risk barriers. Displaying all data on the
            bowtie enables everyone to see the complete risk context, together
            with the activities they are responsible for.

          <h3>Analyze and assess</h3>
          <p>
            Once you have built a bowtie diagram, you can analyze and assess the
            safety barriers that you’ve implemented. Various categories can be
            linked to these barriers to identify amongst others the
            effectiveness, type or accountability of each barrier. Analyze the
            barrier effectiveness to get instant visual insight into the
            strength of your barriers. In hazardhive barrier effectiveness is
            often shown with a traffic light color code, but this is
            customizable to your needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Analyzing <strong>barrier types</strong> will help you to increase
            the robustness of the organization and decrease the likelihood of
            common mode failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Accountability</strong> can be linked to barriers via
            customizable job titles. This helps to get insight into which people
            are responsible for the performance of safety barriers. It makes
            transparent what everybody is supposed to do to operate safely and
            increases ownership of barrier performance.
          </p>
          <img

          <p>
            In hazardhive you can easily
            <strong>generate risk matrices</strong> to assess if you’ve
            adequately controlled all your risks in a visual way. The risk
            matrices can easily be customized to company standards. Inherent and
            residual risk assessments allow demonstration of improvement in risk
            levels.

          <p>
            Bowtie diagrams ensure easy risk communication by making the risk
            visual and understandable on the right abstraction level. To
            distribute the bowtie diagrams, organizations are using posters,
            pocketbooks and leaflets for example to highlight key risk control
            issues. Web-based bowtie diagrams are also increasingly a part of
            online training and information systems. This makes sure that risk
            communication is fully integrated into the organization.
          </p>
          <img

            alt="Structure knowledge example"
          />
          <p>
            Besides being easy to understand, bowties also provide an overview
            and insight in risk analysis and assessment. This is due to the fact
            that bowtie diagrams reduce complexity to a manageable size without
            losing context and focus on the critical elements. The bowtie
            diagram can be communicated to every department within your
            organization, using several filter options in the software. Filters
            allow you to decide which information you want to display on your
            diagram, without deleting any information. For example, you can
            filter the diagram on a specific job title to show the relevant
            information for this particular accountable person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bowtie diagrams can also be used to demonstrate that risks are being
            controlled. This provides management with the assurance that risks
            are being managed properly. This was the primary driver for the
            implementation of the approach within Shell in the mid-1990’s.
            Because of the visual power of the bowtie diagram, many regulators
            in various industries recommend bowtie diagrams to be used in safety
            studies or safety cases.

          <h3>User-friendly diagrams</h3>
          <p>
            Building a diagram in hazardhive is easy and user-friendly. When
            hovering over elements, plus buttons will appear which allows you to
            add new bowtie elements. These plus buttons make the software more
            intuitive and much faster to use. It is possible to adjust your
            bowtie any time and information can be added to the diagram easily
            because of the ‘dragging and dropping’ functionality.

          <p>
            One example of a user-friendly functionality in hazardhive is ‘group
            editing’. This feature allows you to select multiple elements in
            your diagrams for bulk editing. For example, if you want to set
            criticality, or edit the text on 15 barriers at once.

          <p>
            The filters in hazardhive can be used to communicate the bowties to
            your employees or management. With the selective visibility filter,
            you can choose which information should be hidden by simply
            selecting the elements you don’t want to show. The advanced filter
            allows you to filter on basically every element you added to the
            diagram.

          <p>
            You can also choose to select only one characteristic to become
            visible on your bowtie diagram, such as job titles and effectiveness
            values. In hazardhive Standard this is done by adjusting the display
            settings, where types of information can be toggled on or off. In
            hazardhive Complete, these settings can be stored as customized
            display profiles. That way you can store your favorite display
            settings and access those from the drop-down menu (see figure). It
            provides a quick overview of all the data you find relevant.

            organizational control is weak, enabling resources to be targeted at
            those areas where most benefit is likely to be gained. A list of
            recommendations and one-time actions can be obtained from
            hazardhive. Subsequently, this list can be and communicated to the
            accountable person in order to improve your bowtie and risk
            management.

          <h3>Custom terms & taxonomies</h3>
          <p>
            While for some industries it’s common to use the term barrier,
            others use the term ‘safety control’. Any label in the software can
            be changed to meet your own terminology requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            hazardhive provides a standard taxonomy in the software, but some
            organizations require rather industry-specific taxonomies. In the
            lookup tables, you can change your barrier types, barrier
            effectiveness, and so on, to whatever suits your organization needs.

          <h3>Reporting</h3>
          <p>
            hazardhive Standard contains numerous reports to choose from. The
            reports will run in Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel. In hazardhive
            Complete it is possible to run reports based on your own customized
            templates. For example, a template can be made for a standardized
            quarterly report on all barriers or your audit results. Using
            Microsoft Word, links can be added into a regular Word document
            where hazardhive Complete will insert the requested data. This can
            be done in a tabular form, with pictures or other forms of data. The
            result can be an automatically generated report including title
            page, company logos, chapter numbering, table of contents and much
            more.
